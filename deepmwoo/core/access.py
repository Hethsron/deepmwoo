    @version    0.0.1
    @date       October 23th, 2020
    
    @note       For this program, we recommand to use the existing virtual
                environment that allows you to avoid installing Python
                packages globally which could break system tools or other projects 
    
    @pre        Before you can start installing or using packages in the
                existing virtual environment, you'll need to activate it.
                Activating this virtual environment will put the virtual
                environment-specifi python and pip executables into your
                shell's PATH.
                    -   On macOS and Linux, run :
                            source env/bin/activate
                    -   On Windows, run :
                            .\env\Scripts\activate

    @post       If you want to switch projects or otherwise leave this virtual
                environment, simply run :
                            deactivate

    @bug        No known bug to date
    @warning    Misuse could cause program crash
